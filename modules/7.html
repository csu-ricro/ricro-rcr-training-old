		<h1>Human Safety</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-box">When conducting research at CSU, it is important to protect yourself, as well as other individuals that may be used for a research study. This module focuses on the ethics of human welfare as a component of responsible conduct of research. Since most institutions mandate training for those working with humans, this module will introduce you to the institutional and investigator responsibilities when working with humans, as well as the resources and committees available to you at CSU in order to ensure compliance and safety with your research.</p>

		<h1>Use of Human Subjects</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-box">
			To advance knowledge in many areas, research requires the involvement of humans. <strong>Biomedical researchers</strong> focus on solving both life threatening and debilitating diseases that require the use of human subjects to further our knowledge towards possible cures. <strong>Social scientists</strong> use a variety of methods to study all aspects of human culture and behavior, which can include experimenting with human subjects in a laboratory setting, or gathering data from subjects through interviews or questionnaires.
			<br><br>
			As a consequence of such events as the Nuremberg Trials at the end of World War II and the Tuskegee Syphilis study, regulations now ensure that the human subjects are respected and treated appropriately. By conducting research with attention to ethics, institutions and researchers not only foster their reputations for excellence, but also ensure consistency in data and enable the participants and the public to trust their work and research findings.</p>

		<h1>Principles and Policy</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-box">
			Development of formal codes of ethics and public policies for human subjects research began in the mid 20th century. These codes and policies were often developed in response to objectionable practices from specific studies, and have played a role in the development of the federal regulations we follow today.
			<br><br>
			CSU is required to comply with the federal regulations governing review of research that involves human subjects. Annually we must assure the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) that the University is complying with the requirements of <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html">45 CFR 46</a>. This is an NIH reference, but has been incorporated virtually verbatim into the regulations of 16 other federal agencies; additionally, we state that the University will apply the same standards to all projects involving human subjects, regardless of funding or funding source. Funded activities are to be reviewed by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) as proposals, prior to receiving funding.

				<h3>Nuremberg Code</h3>
				<h5>1947</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>A set of research ethics principles were established in August of 1947 for human experimentation as a result of the Nuremberg Trials at the end of World War II.</p>
				<ul class="text-left">
					<li>Developed in response to the inhumane experiments on humans conducted by Nazi doctors.</li>
					<li>The Nazi doctors were convicted of murder, not for being unethical researchers.</li>
					<li>The Code had no immediate effect on research conduct.</li>
					<li>Medical profession thought it was a description of criminal research and created after the fact to convict Nazis.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p><strong>Key Principles</strong></p>
				<ul class="text-left">
					<li>Informed consent and absence of coercion;</li>
					<li>Benefit to society;</li>
					<li>Properly formulated scientific experimentation; and</li>
					<li>Beneficence towards experiment participants: minimize risks and maximize benefit to the research subjects.</li>

				<h3>Declaration of Helsinki</h3>
				<h5>1964</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The Declaration of Helsinki was developed in1964 by the World Medical Association (WMA) as a set of ethical principles for the medical community regarding human experimentation.  
					<br><br>
					It was a reinterpretation of the ten principles of the Nuremberg Code.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Key Principles</strong></p>
				<ul class="text-left">
					<li>Respect for the individual.</li>
					<li>The right to self-determination and the right to make informed decisions regarding participation in research.</li>
					<li>The investigator’s duty is solely to the patient or volunteer.</li>

				<h3>National Research Act</h3>
				<h5>1974</h5>
				<hr>
				<p>Public scrutiny surrounding the Tuskegee Syphilis study led to the enactment of the National Research Act (Public Law 93-348) in 1974.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="text-left">
					This act created the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research.
					<br><br>
					Charge to the Commission was twofold:
				</p>
				<ul class="text-left">
					<li>Identify the basic ethical principles that underlie the conduct of human research.</li>
					<li>Develop guidelines to assure that human research is conducted in accordance with those principles.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The outcome of the work of the Commission was the Belmont Report (1979), which is now considered the definitive document on ethical treatment of human subjects involved in research projects.</p>

					<li>The IRB must be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members, and the diversity of the members, including consideration of race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects.(45 CFR 46.107)</li>
