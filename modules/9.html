		<h1>Conflict of Interest</h1>
		<h4><em>Working Together - Creating Knowledge</em></h4>
		<hr>
		<div class="text-box">
			The issue of Conflict of Interest (COI) has gained visibility in the national media and in the research community as a result of increased funding from industry and a growing number of researchers engaged in consulting. Highly publicized cases where researchers failed to report significant COI have emerged at several preeminent institutions.
			<br><br>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Conflicts of interest, or at least potential conflicts of interest, never will be entirely removed from our modern and increasingly complex society. The goal for universities and companies should be to recognize and pragmatically manage conflict-of-interest issues in a way that preserves the core values of academia and fosters the benefits of innovation for all society.</p>

					</blockquote>
					<p class="text-left">These individuals can include co-PIs, post-docs, students, study coordinators, research technicians, data analysts, IRB members or anyone involved in technology transfer, procurement, education, and healthcare.</p>
					<p class="text-left">Individual financial conflict of interest which affects these individuals may include, but is not limited to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Gifts supporting the principal investigator’s research activity</li>
						<li>Proposals that would affect the investigator’s financial interest in an outside entity</li>
						<li>Technology licensing agreements whereby the investigator has a financial interest</li>

				<th>Institutional - Financial</th>

					<p class="text-left">Examples may include:</p>

						<li>Potential external relationships with a significant financial impact for the University</li>
						<li>Potential conflicts of interests that create serious policy issues or have a significant impact on the University’s mission or reputation</li>
						<li>Potential conflicts surrounding the financial actions of the President of the University</li>
						<li>Ownership in companies making significant contributions to endowed chairs or faculty</li>
						<li>Financial and intellectual property holdings (e.g. Institution has a financial  interest in technology, company, or invention and the research is conducted at that Institution).</li>

					<ul>
						<li>Examples of Non-financial COI may include1:</li>
						<li>Career and/or Personal Advancement (e.g., Researcher interests affect communication and decision-making) </li>
						<li>Favoritism – Family and Other (e.g., Institution adopts a policy which provides significant non-financial benefit to another party). </li>
