		<h1>Why Responsible Conduct of Research?</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-box text-left">
			The research community assumes a standard of integrity in research. We expect that
			all investigators share similar ethical values, such as honesty and objectivity, that they
			conduct research appropriately, and that they pass these values and ethics on to the
			next generation of investigators. Federal agencies increasingly emphasize activities
			that enhance education and training in the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR).
			<br><br>
			Over the past 15 years academic institutions have experienced numerous
			investigations and settlements related to research compliance; CSU, too, has been
			impacted by misconduct investigations. Clear codes of conduct and training in RCR
			are needed to keep CSU in good standing with the external agencies that sponsor
			over 300 million dollars in research each year. 
			<br><br>
			This course will provide you with tools to reduce research misconduct, develop
			stewardship and promote integrity across the entire university.
