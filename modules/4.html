		<h1>Discussing Authorship</h1>
		<hr>
		<div class="text-box">
			Early discussions regarding the division of credit within research groups (especially those anticipating a publication) can prevent later challenges in attributing appropriate authorship. The best practice is to determine the authorship credit early and explicitly communicate the determination to all researchers. 
			<br><br>
			Sensitivity should be given to each researcher based on the role performed. If, for example, a graduate student invites an undergraduate student to contribute to the research, and the graduate student sets the project in motion and defines the role of the undergraduate student, then additional credit should be given to the graduate student.
			<br><br>
			Even senior researchers understand the importance of giving credit where credit is due. Any significant contribution by a junior researcher should be recognized by giving the junior researcher co-author credit.<sup>1</sup>
			<br><br>
			At times, there may be pressure to include an <a id="honorary-researcher" class="more">honorary researcher</a> even though that person performed little of the research.
			<br><br>
			<div id="more-honorary-researcher" class="display-none">
				<strong>Honorary Researchers</strong>
				<hr>
				The honorary researcher may be a department chair where the research was conducted or had provided funds to initiate the research.  Recognizing an honorary researcher gives him or her more credit than is due.  In addition, it lessens the credit provided to the other authors.  Even though the honorary researcher may have made some type of contribution, they should not be listed as authors if they did not actively partake in and make a significant contribution to the research performed.

		<h1>Authorship Credit</h1>
		<hr>
		<div class="text-box">
			According to the ICMJE Statement of Authorship, An “author” is generally considered to be someone who has made substantive intellectual contributions to a published study.
			<br>
			Authorship credit should be based on:
			<ul class="text-left">
				<li>substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data</li>
				<li>drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content</li>
				<li>final approval of the version to be published</li>
				<li>Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</li>
			</ul>
			All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those whqualify should be listed.
			<br><br>
			Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.<sup>1</sup>

		<h1>Not included as an author? Were you plagiarized?</h1>
		<hr>
		<div class="text-box">
			According to the Office of Research Integrity’s working definition, “ORI considers plagiarism to include both the theft or misappropriation of intellectual property and the substantial unattributed textual copying of another’s work. It does not include authorship or credit disputes.”<sup>1</sup>
			<br><br>
			When researchers collaborate and participate jointly in a research project and later go their separate ways, it is not considered plagiarism if one of the researchers publishes or makes independent use of the jointly developed methods and results. The collaborative nature of scientists “supports a presumption of implied consent to use the products of the collaboration by any of the former collaborators.”<sup>1</sup> 
			<br><br>
			ORI considers this scenario to represent an authorship and credit dispute, but not a form of plagiarism.

		<h1>Peer Review</h1>
		<hr>
		<div class="text-box">
			The peer review process allows verification of research findings of both papers and research grants. Its true, ultimate goal is to validate scholarly work, research, and ideas through the review of many parties. It is important to the research community, its numerous sponsors, and the public at large to allow this process to take its time.
			<br><br>
			All major funding agencies today require peer review of grant applications. To initiate the peer review process, the application goes before a committee of peers. Depending on the agency or sponsor, it may also go to external reviewers for their input as well. Click here to read examples of <a id="nih" class="more">NIH's</a> and <a id="nsf" class="more">NSF's</a> peer review process. 
			<br>
			<div id="more-nih" class="display-none">
				<blockquote class="center-block">
					The NIH has a double review: the application is first reviewed by a committee of peers and then, if approved at the first level, is reviewed further by an advisory council. 
				</blockquote>
			</div>
			<div id="more-nsf" class="display-none">
				<blockquote class="center-block">
					The National Science Foundation (NSF) proposals are reviewed by a program officer and three to ten outside NSF experts. The program officer receives comments about the application by mail, panel meetings, or site visits. Senior staff at the NSF then review the recommendations of the program officer.  Finally, a division director decides whether an award is approved for funding.
				</blockquote>
			</div>
			<br>
			Peer review centers around the idea that peers with similar backgrounds and experience are best able to review a publication under consideration. The peer review takes place after the findings are submitted to a journal for publication. The journal forwards the findings to peer reviewers, who may be a mixture of internal and external resources. In many cases, the reviewer knows the identity of the author but the author does not know the identity of the reviewer. Based on the feedback from the peer reviewers, the journal editor will then determine  whether to accept the publication as is, accept the publication with modifications, or reject the publication.

		<h1>Policies & Procedures</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-box">
			Recently the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published peer review standards which indicate when peer review is required and what type of peer review processes are appropriate standards. This policy was made to make sure that when important scientific information is disseminated it is reviewed by qualified specialists.
			<br><br>
			Almost all federal agencies in the U.S. government must comply with these standards before the agency can disseminate certain scientific findings that they funded.  All influential scientific information from federal agencies must be submitted to the peer review process before it can be made available to the public.

				<hr>
				Its critics say it is slow, misunderstood, and sometimes just not effective.  The critics aside, here are some of the reasons to have the peer review process:

					<li>Reduce mistakes and errors</li>
					<li>Identify weaknesses</li>
					<li>Allows more work to be reviewed</li>
					<li>Allows for a diversity of opinions</li>
					<li>Protect the public from erroneous claims and discoveries</li>
					<li>Optimize the best use of scarce resources</li>
					<li>Discourages cronyism in funding and publishing</li>

					<li>It is a slow process</li>
					<li>Fraught with conflicts of interest</li>

			Dr. Cook and Dr. Bedell are prominent researchers from distinct fields. Dr. Cook is a noted social scientist who agrees to collaborate with Dr. Bedell, a top infectious diseases researcher. They set clear project objectives from the start and although they use different methodologies, their research study produces eye opening results. Although they had revealing results, Dr. Cook and Dr. Bedell decide to go their separate ways, and continue doing research in their specialties of social science and infectious disease.
			<br><br>
			Years later, after Dr. Bedell completes research on AIDS, he publishes an article using findings from this study, as well as from the research he and Dr. Cook completed upwards of five years ago, without giving Dr. Cook any authorship credit. Dr. Cook reads the article and sues Dr. Bedell for plagiarism.
