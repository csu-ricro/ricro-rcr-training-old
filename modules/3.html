		<h1>Research Misconduct</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-box">
			At Colorado State University we promote the highest level of integrity in all research teaching and service activities. We understand the importance of protecting the integrity of academic work
			 and the need for stewardship of public and private funds. All faculty, staff and students are charged with conducting themselves with integrity and honesty. It is devastating to both individuals
			 and institutions to be charged with research misconduct, so it is important to understand the processes that should be used to resolve professional problems before they lead to allegations of misconduct,
			 and to know who to contact should you suspect or witness misconduct.

This is an informal, preliminary step to determine if a concern or allegation is entirely frivolous and devoid of reason to pursue, if it should be referred to another office for resolution or if it should be referred to an Inquiry Committee for further fact finding and evaluation."

		<h1>Case Study: Nelson Nice</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-box">Nelson Nice is on the engineering faculty. Three years ago he headed a research project funded by the National Science Foundation that involved an undergraduate student assistant, Jason Smart.  Jason worked for a few months on the project but left the project before the work was completed.
			<br><br>
			One year later Jason, then a graduate student at another university, wrote to Nelson Nice and asked him if he would send him a copy of the final report of the work they had done together.  Jason explained that he was now working in a related area and that it would help him to see how things worked out in the project.  Dr.  Nice was not anxious to share the report with Jason Smart.  However, he was impressed with Jason's interest in the overall area and did not want to discourage him.  Dr. Nice ultimately sent the report to Jason and pointed out to him that, although the research was now complete, it had not turned out as he had hoped, and he had no plans to do further work in the area.  Dr. Nice wished Jason well and hoped that this report might be of some help in giving him new ideas.
			<br><br>
			Several years later Dr. Nice discovered that Jason Smart used the report as his Master's Thesis -- adding only a couple of introductory paragraphs, a concluding section, and an updated bibliography. No reference to Nelson Nice appeared anywhere in the thesis!
