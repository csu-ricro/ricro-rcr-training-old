This section will provide you the tools to understand your role and responsibility in maintaining strong relationships with the external sponsors.</p>

		<h1>Laptop Woes at a University</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-box">
			A recent audit at Duke University has highlighted problems with the purchase of a laptop on federal grants. In a Duke audit, one of the disallowed costs was a laptop costing $3,364 (plus F&A of $1,817 totaling $5,181). The sum represented 13.3% of the disallowed costs. Because it was a statistical audit, the costs were extrapolated to the population as a whole. As a result, the laptop ultimately represented $221,260 of the overall disallowance of $1,661,011 from that audit. 
			<br><br>
			The University had charged the NIH grant $3,364 for a laptop computer and asserted that the computer was used solely for project data and allowed the employee ‘the opportunity to work from home or wherever she may be located at anytime of the day.’ The auditor noted, however, that the involved employee devoted only 5 percent of her time to the project charged for her computer. The auditor did not accept the assertion that the computer was used solely for project data. 
			<br><br>
			An auditor could ask to see a laptop and then determine what programs and data are on it. If there is an internet browser, an e-mail program, and lots of e-mails, one may get total disallowance unless each e-mail and contact is specifically related to the project to which the laptop was charged. The burden of proof in this situation is on the user not the auditor; a case of guilty until proven innocent.
