		<h1>Who is a mentor?</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-box">Experienced professionals with impartial insight and knowledge to benefit mentees, who are well versed in institutional and regulatory policies and procedures.
			<br><br>
			While most mentors stand out as senior faculty or Principal Investigators, any junior faculty or Post-Doctoral Researcher who fosters and guides the development of less experienced staff are also considered mentors since their role is inclusive of imparting knowledge and cultivating skills.

			<p>"Mentoring is one of the primary means for one generation of scientists to impart their knowledge to succeeding generations. More than textbooks and formal classes, the relatively informal dimensions of scientific research, including the relationship between mentor and trainee, prepare the next generation of science professionals"</p>

		<h1>Who is the trainee?</h1>
		<hr>
		<p class="text-box">While mentors act as resources to guide and train their mentees, trainees also play 
			an important role in the relationship. Knowing whom to contact, what is expected 
			regarding their role and understanding both institutional and regulatory guidelines 
			relating to sponsored research are essential for success. 
			<br><br>
			Trainees may include recent undergraduates, foreign Fellows or post-doctoral 
			researchers. As such, their needs will vary and mentors should adapt to those unique 
			needs.

			Samantha Jackson is a post-doc working in the lab of Dr. Luis Lopez.  She is a tenacious student and spends nearly seven days a week in the lab putting final touches on her thesis which is due in a few weeks. Lately, she has put off her own work to assist Dr. Lopez with some lab experiments; for which the results will be presented at an important national seminar next Thursday.  
			<br><br>
			As she is heading out the door for the weekend, Dr. Lopez asks Samantha if she is able to analyze more data and prepare figures and graphs. While she intended to work on her thesis, she knew he needed the help so agreed.  He thanked her and explained she would be listed as the third author behind him and the data collector, Meredith.  
			<br><br>
			Samantha leaves and tells Dr. Lopez she looks forward to working with him in the morning, to which he smirks and replies he will not be there.
