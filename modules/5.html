		<h1>Collaborative Science</h1>
		<hr>
		<div class="text-box">
			<p>Collaborative research occurs when two or more researchers work together on a project. Collaboration can take many different forms.</p>
			<br>
			<ul class="text-left">
				<li><strong>Proximity</strong>: Collaboration may occur internally, across disciplines, across institutions, and/or around the globe.</li>
				<li><strong>Project size</strong>:  Collaborative research ranges from one-on-one partnerships to multi-faceted projects involving numerous researchers from varied backgrounds and everything in between.</li>
				<li><strong>Institutional Partners</strong>: Collaborations may occur with researchers based at universities, nonprofits, or commercial entities.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			Collaboration is enhanced at CSU by its multicultural, global campus. With approximately 1,200 foreign students and scholars from over 90 different countries, their various backgrounds, cultures, and ideas enable CSU to be one of the nation’s leading research universities.
