		<p class="text-box">When conducting research at CSU, it is important to protect yourself, as well as other individuals and animals that may be used for a research study. This module will introduce you to the importance of laboratory safety in order to protect yourself while conducting research.</p>

				<h3>Dartmouth College, 1996</h3>
				<hr>
				<em>Professor Karen Wetterhahn, founding director of the University’s Toxic Metals Research Program, spilled a drop of dimethylmercury on her gloved hand. She died 10 months later. Her mercury levels were 80 times the toxic threshold.</em>
				<br><br>
				<p class="text-left"><strong>She was following the standard safety protocol at the time which included:</strong></p>
				<ul class="text-left">
					<li>Conducting the chemical transfer in a fume hood</li>
					<li>Wearing eye protection</li>
					<li>Wearing disposable latex gloves</li>
					<li>Following the directions on the MSDS sheet</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-left"><strong>What went wrong?</strong></p>
				<ul class="text-left">
					<li>There was no industry level permeation testing on dimethylmercury to determine the type of glove would provide adequate protection</li>

				<h3>UCLA, 2008</h3>
				<hr>
				<em>Sheri Sangi, a research assistant, was transferring a tert-butyllithium solution in hexanes when the plunger of the syringe she was using separated from the barrel, spraying her hands with the pyrophoric compound. The chemicals ignited and lit her sweater on fire. Her coworkers doused the flames and she was rushed to the hospital. She died from her injuries weeks later.</em>
				<br><br>
				<p class="text-left"><strong>What went wrong?</strong></p>
				<ul class="text-left">
					<li>She never received adequate training for working with hazardous chemicals</li>
					<li>She did not follow proper safety procedures for handling pyrophoric reagents</li>
					<li>She did not wear a lab coat</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-left"><strong>What were the consequences?</strong></p>
				<ul class="text-left">
					<li>
						Felony criminal charges were filed against both the University of California Regents and Professor Harran for willfully violating occupational health and safety standards.
						<ul>
							<li>In 2012 UCLA enacted stringent policies and SOP’s regarding hazardous chemicals and began inspecting labs more frequently. Lab safety training classes became mandatory and fire-resistant lab coats were made available to workers.</li>
							<li>On June 20th, 2014 Professor Harran reached a deferred prosecution agreement with the condition that the 4 criminal counts will be dropped in 5 years if he pays $10K in fines, fulfills 800 hours of community service at UCLA’s hospital, and conducts a summer chemistry course for inner-city high school graduates.</li>

			<strong>Centers for Disease Control, 2014, Atlanta, GA</strong>
			<br>
			<ul class="text-left">
				<li>It was feared that 75 people were exposed to live anthrax after improper shipment of live bacteria.  Employees not wearing protective gear worked with bacteria that were supposed to have been killed but may not have been.  All were offered a vaccine and antibiotics.</li>
				<li>A culture of non-pathogenic bird flu was cross-contaminated with the highly virulent H5N1 strain at its influenza laboratory in early 2014 before being shipped to a facility operated by the Department of Agriculture.</li>

			<strong>Texas Tech University, 2010, Lubbock, TX</strong>
			<br>
			A graduate student removed protective eye wear before crushing nickel hydrazine perchlorate with a mortal and pestle on the bench top.  The substance detonated, and the student suffered serious injuries to his face, an eye, and lost 3 fingers.
			<br><br>
			<strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 2008, Boulder, CO.</strong>

			Researcher broke a bottle of plutonium sulfate.  Upon washing his hands to remove the spill he introduced plutonium into the Boulder sewer system and subsequently to the hallway surrounding the lab.

			<h3>Recently at CSU...</h3>
			<hr>
			<ul class="text-left">
				<li>A chemistry graduate student was transferring waste when a chemical in the container reacted and caused a gas expansion, resulting in an explosion, causing the student serious injuries.</li>
				<li>An employee was performing a dissection in a biosafety cabinet on an animal infected with a BSL3 infectious agent.  During the procedure, the lymph node exploded unexpectedly, resulting in a biological spill and potentially exposing the worker and others to the agent.  This incident was not reported for several weeks as the worker did not think it was a reportable event, was very busy, and forgot about it.</li>
				<li>A student suffered a serious eye injury (hole in cornea) from a laser while improperly adjusting optics without the appropriate eye protection</li>
				<li>An employee suffered a puncture wound from a needle contaminated with human tumor cells.  Employee underwent a biopsy to monitor for cancer cell invasion.</li>
